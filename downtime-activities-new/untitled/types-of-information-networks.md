# Types of Information Networks



## 

 Sources of information can be extremely valuable. Entire groups often know things that any given individual might not. The exact nature of the information is usually based on the make-up of the group: street and criminal contacts usually know what's going on in the shadows, while noble contacts are aware of happenings in the aristocratic sphere. Some kinds of information networks available:

Bureaucratic: This category relates to the bureaucratic and judicial operations of the city, from low-level clerks to the doings of the Magistrates and Masked Lords. 

Criminal: This category relates to the activities of the city's criminal world, from low-level pickpockets to gangs to fences, usurists, and criminal compacts. 

Diplomatic: This category relates to the city's interactions with other nations and city-states, and the governments thereof. 

Defense: This category relates to both the city Watch and Guard, and to their inner workings as well as what activities and events that concern them at the moment. 

Mercantile: This category touches on the doing of industry and mercantile life, including information about the Guilds as well. 

Nightlife: This category covers events at the myriad nightlife locations in the city, from taverns to inns to festhalls, as well as theaters, artistic performances, festivals and similar events. 

Racial: This category covers information about one of the peoples of the city - dwarves, elves, and other demihumans - who do not make up the majority of the population. 

Religious: This category covers information about things going on in temples and in religious life in the city in general. 

Street: This category covers the rough lives of a city's populace, from beggars and the homeless to those who simply work hard for poor earnings.

### The Rewards of Information

There are two core rewards gained through the use of information networks: secrets and rumors.

* **Secrets:** These are core pieces of vital information, as assured as any whispered lore can be. They are usually valuable and immediately useful, either revealing pertinent information of use to one, or at least to someone else \(which can then be sold\).
* **Rumors:** Rumors are more common and less assured. They may hint at interesting events, warn of future occurrences, suggest strange goings-on or simply tell of current events that may be manipulated for one's gain. They are far less reliable, and rumors tend to be worth nothing in coin \(although it's not uncommon to trade rumors among one's fellows\).
