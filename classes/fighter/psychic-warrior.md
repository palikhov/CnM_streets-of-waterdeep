A Psychic Warrior combines the study of psionics with martial training, yielding a warrior who can transcend their physical limits while delivering skilled, deadly attacks.

## Spellcasting

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

### Cantrips. 

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the psionic spell list. You learn an additional wizard or psionic cantrip at 10th level.

### Spell Slots. 

The Psychic Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spells slots you have to case your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. 

You know three 1st-level spells of your choice chosen from the psionic spell list.

The Spells Known column \[currently unavailable\] of the Psychic Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be chosen from the psionic spell list, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Whenever you gain a fighter level, you can replace one of the psionic spells you know with another spells of your choice from the psionic spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability. 

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

## Psychic Destroyer

Starting at 3rd level, you can expend your spell energy to imbue your attacks with psychic power. Once during your turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal psychic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

## Psychic Guardian

Starting at 3rd level, you can expend your spell energy to protect your allies from harm. When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to grant that ally a bonus to AC equal to 3 + the spell slot's level, including against the triggering attack, until the end of your next turn.

## Psychic Warrior \(Livestream\): Psychic Storm

At 7th level, your aggression translates into an aura of disruptive psychic energy. If you cast a psionic cantrip or use the attack action on your turn, all hostile creatures within 10 feet of you take psychic damage equal to double your Intelligence modifier \(minimum 1\).

## Psychic Warrior \(Livestream\): Psionic Recovery

Starting at 10th level, when you use your Second Wind class feature you also regain an expended 1st-level spell slot.

## Psychic Warrior \(Livestream\): Psionic Surge

At 15th level, you gain the ability to channel additional psionic power when you use your Action Surge class feature. Until the end of your turn, if your attack or spell causes a creature to take psychic damage, that creature takes an additional 1d10 psychic damage. A creature can take this additional damage only once during your turn.

## Psychic Warrior \(Livestream\): Mind Cleaver

At 18th level, your attacks leave behind traces of disruptive, psychic energy. If you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause it to become vulnerable to psychic energy until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
