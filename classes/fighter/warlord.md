## Tactical Focus

At 3rd level, your tactical acumen allows you to study an area of a battlefield and provide direction to your allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action or as part of the attack action, you can select an area on the ground that measures 10 feet on each side. This area is your tactical focus. It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you are unable to take actions.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 15 level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can swap on of your tactics for a different one.

## Tactics.

### Advance. 

You and your allies can move 10 ft. in your tactical focus for every 5 feet of movement expended there.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Changed during stream to "You and your allies can basically teleport into your focus. Movement on allies turn." Specifically, the movement is not made as a reactionâ€”your allies can use their movement on their turn\(s\) to move towards the focus, and gain bonuses to speed or other effects \(for example, ignoring difficult terrain, or movement does not provoke opportunity attacks\) to aid and incentivize this. Additionally, this may replace "Cover That Flank" in future.
{% endhint %}

###  Clear the area. 

If an ally hits a creature in your tactical focus with an attack, the ally can move that creature 5 ft. in addition to the attack's other effects.

### Cover That Flank. 

When a hostile creature that you can see enters your tactical focus, up to three target creatures of your choice that can see the creature can use a reaction to move up to their speed. The targets must end their movement in the tactical focus. A target creature that ends this movement adjacent to the triggering creature regains its reaction.

### Form Shield Wall. 

Allies in your tactical focus gain a +2 bonus to AC while they are adjacent to an ally using a shield. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[In future, this will likely be changed to benefit only creatures not already wielding a shield, and to affect each creature at most once.\]
{% endhint %}

### Get Down. 

If an allied creature in your tactical focus must make a Dexterity saving throw it can use its reaction to move up to its speed. If this movement takes it out of the range or area of the effect that caused the saving throw, it is no longer subjected to the effect. \[In future, this may be changed to instead give advantage on the saving throw, or require the creature to drop prone, or cancel the creature's next move.\]

### Reorder Ranks. 

Allies in your tactical focus do not provoke opportunity attacks while they are within 5 feet of an ally. In addition, you and your allies can end movement in an ally's space. That ally immediately moves so that you do not occupy the same space, but it must end that move at least partially occupying your tactical focus. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[Noted as requiring cleanup.\]
{% endhint %}



The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.

## Tactician's Insight

Starting at 3rd level, you can grant your allies useful tactical insights while they are in the area of your tactical focus.

You gain a number of uses of insight based on your fighter level.

As a bonus action or as a part of an attack action you grant insight to yourself or allies in your tactical focus. You grant this benefit to yourself and as many allies as you wish in your focus, but you cannot expend more uses than you currently have 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[or more than the maximum in the table below. A creature can receive more than one Tactician's Insight when you take this action.\]
{% endhint %}

A creature that gains your insight can use it in two ways. It can regain hit points immediately upon receiving it. Roll 2d10 and the creature regains that many hit points. If the creature would gain hit points that place it above its maximum, it gains the difference as temporary hit points.

Alternatively, a creature can save the insight to use when it hits with an attack. It increases the attack's damage by 2d10.

You regain expended uses of Tactician's Insight when you complete a long rest.

| Tactician's Insight |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fighter Level | Uses | Maximum | Gambits |
| 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| 4-6 | 3 | 1 | 0 |
| 7-9 | 7 | 2 | 3 |
| 10-12 | 9 | 2 | 4 |
| 13-15 | 14 | 3 | 5 |
| 16-18 | 16 | 3 | 6 |
| 19-20 | 20 | 4 | 7 |

## Warlord \(Livestream\): Additional Tactic

At 7th level, you learn an additional tactic of your choice.

## Warlord \(Livestream\): Tactical Gambits

Starting at 7th level, your tactical cunning allows you to seize the moment in battle.

At 7th level, you learn two gambits. You learn an additional gambit at 10th and 18th level.

You use a gambit as an action. You can use your gambits a number of times based on your fighter level.

Each time you complete a long rest, you regain all expended uses of your gambits and can swap one of your gambits for a different one.

### Saving Throws. 

A gambit sometimes requires a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Gambit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Gambits. 

The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.

### Aggressive Advance. 

You and your allies howl in rage and glower at your foes, making a display that sends fear into their hearts.

Hostile creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened of your tactical focus. A creature frightened by this effect can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[In future, may be changed to require you or an ally to be present within the focus.\]
{% endhint %}

### Cut Them Down!. 

You direct your allies to strike with perfect timing. Landing blows just as your enemies are of balance to send them tumbling to the ground.

Until the end of your next turn, hostile creatures in your tactical focus that you can see must make Strength saves each time they are hit by an attack. On a failed save, they are knocked prone. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

### Luring Gambit. 

You entangle your weapon with a chose foe, luring it to duel you as your allies close in for the kill.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. If you hit a creature with a weapon attack during your turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your allies are invisible to it until the end of your next turn.

### Pile On. 

You direct your allies' attacks against a target, each blow building on the next to build a devastating result. Select a creature in your tactical focus that you can see. At the start of your next turn, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw if you or an ally has hit it with an attack since you used this ability. It suffers disadvantage on the saving throw if it has been hit by three or more attacks \[in future, this may be changed to "hit by three or more creatures"\]. On a failed saving throw, the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

### Pincer Movement. 

With precise timing, you order your allies to charge into the enemy, dealing body checks that leave your foes entangles and helpless.

Up to two allies that can see or hear you can use their reactions to move up to their speed. Any creature adjacent to both of your allies or to you and one of the chosen allies at the end of their movement must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

### Vexing Maneuvers. 

With precise movements, you and your allies dash around the foes to leave them confused and unable to pick out their most dangerous targets.

Each enemy in your tactical focus that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot leave your tactical focus using its move until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit you may take the attack action.

At 10th level, you learn an additional gambit of your choice.

## Warlord \(Livestream\): Lead from the Front

At 10th level you strike with a cunning insight that allows your allies to make effective follow up attacks.

At 15th level, you learn an additional tactic of your choice.

## Warlord \(Livestream\): Tactical Maneuvers

At 15th level, you can provide leadership that allows your allies to move in perfect harmony.

In place of moving, you can instead allow up to three allies who can see or hear you to move up to half their speed. The chosen allies must be capable of taking actions in order to move in this manner.

## Warlord \(Livestream\): Additional Gambit

At 18th level, you learn an additional gambit of your choice.Warlord \(Livestream\): Perfect Coordination

Starting at 18th level, you gain the ability to unleash a devastating combination of your allies' abilities. As a bonus action, select up to five allies who can see or hear you. They can use their reactions to immediately take actions.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
