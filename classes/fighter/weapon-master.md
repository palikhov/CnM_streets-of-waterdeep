A weapon master follows the fighting techniques of the Sublime way. This martial discipline combines a variety of sources, from arcane and divine magic to the hardened resolve of a master warrior, to produce astounding battlefield effects.

## Martial Exploits

Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use your tactical acumen, physical prowess, and sometimes a dash of mystic energy to achieve astounding feats of martial skill.

You gain the ability to use martial exploits. You gain uses based on your fighter level, as shown on the Martial Exploits table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long

You also gain access to one path of the Sublime Way at 3rd level. The Martial Exploits table also shows when you get access to additional paths as you gain fighter levels.

Whenever you gain a fighter level, you can choose to lose access to one path and replace it with access to a different one.

## Masterful Strike

When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to use a martial exploit to land a telling blow. When you make a weapon attack, you can expend a martial exploit. Roll the dice for your exploit along with your attack. If your attack misses, you can use one or more of the exploit's dice results as a bonus to your attack. If the attack hits, apply any unused dice as a bonus to your weapon damage roll.

## Paths of the Sublime Way

Each path of the sublime way features a unique take on combat mastery. Many, but not all, require you to wield certain weapons to use their exploits.

When you use a martial exploit, you can choose to use one of the special exploits listed under one of the paths you know. You choose the special exploit when you decide to use a martial exploit.

Some of these abilities require you to roll fewer dice when using a martial exploit. You cannot use an ability that reduces the total dice you roll for the exploit to less than 1. Such an ability is beyond your skill.

### Saving Throw

Some of these abilities require a creature to make a saving throw. The DC for such a save is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

## Path of the Shadow Harlequin

The Shadow Harlequin path is a school of artful sword play and mesmerizing flourishes. Its practitioners attack a foe's mind and body, maneuvering their foes into tactical blunders with cunning feints and sudden, surprising moves.

Shadow Harlequins typically fight with light, agile weapons, such as rapiers and short swords, but their talents are useful to almost any warrior.

### Come Forth to Dance. 

Your weapon moves in a lazy, hypnotic pattern, luring your foe to blunder ahead and walk into your trap.

As an action, expend a martial exploit and select a creature that can see you within 15 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it moves up to 15 feet closer to you. You then make a single melee attack against it using your martial exploit with one die fewer.

### Cutting Dialogue. 

If this exchange of blows is a dramatic play, let your rejoinder be its final act.

As a reaction when a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can expend a martial exploit and make a melee weapon attack against that creature. You can select one of the dice rolled and add it to your AC against the target's attack.

### Dramatic Exit. 

Your overly dramatic strike distracts your opponent, allowing you to slip away from their grasp.

When you expend a martial exploit when making a melee weapon attack, you can move up to 5 feet, without provoking opportunity attacks, per exploit die rolled after your attack.

## Path of the Stone Dragon

The Stone Dragon path focuses on brutal power and overwhelming toughness. Most of these exploits require you to attack with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile melee weapon you wield in two hands.

Warriors of the Stone Dragon are often cruel destroyers. They fight with the subtlety and irresistible force of an avalanche. Their punishing attacks render their enemies immobile, allowing them to then take careful aim for one, final executioner's blow.

## Adamantine Bones. 

You focus your mind and grit your teeth, pushing aside pain and drawing on wellsprings of energy that blot out the pain of your wounds.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them. You gain temporary hit points equal to the total of the dice + your Constitution modifier \(minimum of 1\).

You can also activate this ability as a bonus action. In that case, you roll your martial exploit dice and gain temporary hit points equal to their total + your Constitution modifier.

### Colossus Strike. 

You swing your weapon in an upward arc, catching your foe in the chest and sending them flying across the battlefield.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them and disregard their result. For each die selected, you push the target 5 feet in a straight line along the ground if your attack hits.

### Jaws of the Stone Dragon. 

Like a mighty dragon pouncing upon a helpless victim, you take stock of an immobilized foe before landing a crushing strike.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking a target that cannot move or with a speed of 0 with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, you gain an additional +2 bonus per die used as a bonus to your weapon damage roll.

### Mountain's Grasp. 

Your blows land with such force that your enemy is left off balance, unable to escape your brutal assault.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select at least two of them and disregard their results. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.

### Sweeping Bludgeon. 

As you ready to strike your enemy, you sweep your weapon around you in a great arc that builds momentum and forces your enemies to dive to the ground to avoid a crushing blow.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them and disregard their result. For each die selected, pick a creature within reach of your attack. Each chosen creature must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Weapon Master \(Livestream\): Way of the Blade

Starting at 7th level, you blend your martial talent with the softer skills needed to navigate the world. If you are holding a weapon when you make a Strength \(Athletics\), Dexterity \(Acrobatics\), or Charisma \(Intimidation\) check, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to half your proficiency bonus. You use your weapon to assist in your check, such as pole vaulting with a staff, using your sword to aid your balance, or menacing an enemy with your bloodied flail.

## Weapon Master \(Livestream\): Superior Fighting Style

Starting at 10th level, your mastery of your fighting style deepens. You can choose a second option from the Fighting Style feature you gain at 2nd level, or you can choose an improved version of a fighting style you already know as detailed below.

### Superior Archery. 

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.Superior Defense. 

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You also gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws.

### Superior Dueling. 

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Superior Great Weapon Fighting. 

When you roll a 1, 2, or 3 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is 1, 2, or 3. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Superior Protection. 

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll and make an opportunity attack against the attacker. You must be wielding a shield.

### Superior Two-Weapon Fighting. 

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand.
