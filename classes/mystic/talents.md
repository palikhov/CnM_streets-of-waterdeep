# Talents

### Beacon 

As a bonus action, you cause bright light to radiate from your body in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. The light lasts for 1 hour, and you can extinguish it earlier as a bonus action.

### Blade Meld 

As a bonus action, a one-handed melee weapon you hold becomes one with your hand. For the next minute, you can't let go of the weapon nor can it be forced from your grasp.

### Blind Spot 

As an action, you erase your image from the mind of one creature you can see within 120 feet of you; the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you are invisible to it until the end of your next turn.

### Delusion 

As an action, you plant a false belief in the mind of one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can create a sound or an image. Only the target of this talent perceives the sound or image you create. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a creature's roar, a musical instrument, or any other sound you pick. It lasts for 1 minute. If you create an object, it must fit within a 5- foot cube and can't move or be reflective. The image can't create any effect that influences a sense other than sight. The image lasts for 1 minute, and it disappears if the creature touches it.

### Energy Beam 

As an action, you target one creature you can see within 90 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage \(your choice\). The talent's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level \(2d8\), 11th level \(3d8\), and 17th level \(4d8\).

### Light Step 

As a bonus action, you alter your density and weight to improve your mobility. For the rest of your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and the first time you stand up this turn, you do so without expending any of your movement if your speed is greater than 0.

### Mind Meld 

As a bonus action, you can communicate telepathically with one willing creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must have an Intelligence of at least 2, otherwise this talent fails and the action is wasted. This communication can occur until the end of the current turn. You don't need to share a language with the target for it to understand your telepathic utterances, and it understands you even if it lacks a language. You also gain access to one memory of the target's choice, gaining perfect recall of one thing it saw or did.

### Mind Slam 

As an action, you target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If it takes any of this damage and is Large or smaller, it is knocked prone. The talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level \(2d6\), 11th level \(3d6\), and 17th level \(4d6\).

### Mind Thrust

 As an action, you target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d10 psychic damage. The talent's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level \(2d10\), 11th level \(3d10\), and 17th level \(4d10\).

### Mystic Charm

 As an action, you beguile one humanoid you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

### Mystic Hand

 You can use your action to manipulate or move one object within 30 feet of you. The object can't weigh more than 10 pounds, and you can't affect an object being worn or carried by another creature. If the object is loose, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. This talent allows you to open an unlocked door, pour out a beer stein, and so on. The object falls to the ground at the end of your turn if you leave it suspended in midair.

### Psychic Hammer

 As an action, you try to grasp one creature you can see within 120 feet of you, with a hand crafted from telekinetic energy. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If it takes any of this damage and is Large or smaller, you can move it up to 10 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. You can't lift the target off the ground unless it is already airborne or underwater. The talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level \(2d6\), 11th level \(3d6\), and 17th level \(4d6\).
